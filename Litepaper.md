Privacy is at the core of the blockchain ecosystem and at the center of the original ideals of the Cypherpunks. However, today with the growing number of blockchain applications in  our  ecosystem  with  use  cases  increasingly  connected  to  the  rest  of  the  world (apartment rental, tokenization of real-world assets, DID…), it is becoming increasingly difficult to detach one’s on-chain identity from one’s own identity. 

1. **Executive<a name="_page1_x68.00_y71.00"></a> Summary**

XRPL Solvency is a solution that addresses the growing need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem by providing a means for individuals and businesses to prove solvency without revealing their wallet address or transaction history. This is achieved through the use of cryptographic  ring  signature  technology  and  other  cryptographic  means  to  generate verifiable, solvency proofs at a specific point in time. The solution is designed for individuals who value their privacy while transacting on blockchain platforms, and it offers a unique value proposition by allowing users to prove solvency without compromising their privacy. Businesses can also benefit from the solution through use-cases we will detail bellow. 

2. **The<a name="_page1_x68.00_y265.00"></a> problem** 

The XRP Ledger is a decentralized, open source blockchain technology that enables fast and secure transactions of digital currencies. While XRP Ledger is serving as a global settlement platform for various types of transactions, generating solvency proofs can be a solution for many problems that actors in the ecosystem will be facing. This interest in solvency proofs creates an opportunity for solutions like the XRPL Solvency project to offer a new, innovative approach to generating proof of solvency that provides greater privacy and security for users, enabling new interactions possibilities.  

By leveraging cryptographic ring signatures and other cryptographic means, XRPL Solvency can generate verifiable solvency proofs that do not reveal the user’s on-chain assets and history associated with their own identity, filling a need that is currently unmet by XRP Ledger-based  solutions.  XRPL  Solvency  could  be  used  to  offer  a  new  level  of  trust  and transparency to the XRP ecosystem, while ensuring the privacy and security of users’ on- chain assets.  

Theoretically, zero-knowledge proofs and more particularly ZK-SNARK are a very good solution to our problem.  

Nevertheless, in practice, many problems arise. Due to their complexity, potential compatibility issues with existing cryptographic primitives, and the need for a trusted setup in some cases, ZK-SNARK are not very user friendly and require for the moment on SECP256k1 very heavy proof files to verify ECDSA (>1Gb). 

SECP256k1 is a widely used elliptic curve cryptography algorithm that is used in many blockchain applications, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and is one of the curves used in XRP Ledger. While SECP256K1 provides a secure means of generating cryptographic signatures and keys, it is not ideally suited for use in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) such as ZK-SNARKs. ZK-SNARKs require pairing-friendly elliptic curve cryptography, which is not a property of SECP256K1. This means that implementing ZK-SNARKs with SECP256K1 is not straightforward and requires additional workarounds that can significantly reduce the efficiency and security of the system. 

As  XRPL  Solvency  is  designed  to  provide  a  highly  secure  and  efficient  means  of generating verifiable solvency proofs, we carefully consider the cryptography algorithms used in the solution. While SECP256K1 is a widely used and secure algorithm, it is not ideally suited for ZK-SNARKs, and other cryptography algorithms may need to be considered to ensure the best possible security and efficiency for the solution. Moreover, using ZK involves a lack of scalability, portability, and compatibility with other chains. Which is inconvenient for further expansion. 

This is why we turned to ring signatures. Being simpler, based on elliptic curves and not requiring a trusted set-up, ring signatures are more suitable for our project. Moreover, ring signature  does  not  require  any  change  at  the  protocol  level.  Making  it  a  scalable  and customizable solution. 

3. **The<a name="_page2_x68.00_y267.00"></a> solution** 

Our  solution  stands  in  2  words:  Ring  Signatures.  Ring  signatures  are  a  type  of  digital signature that allows a member of a group to sign a message on behalf of the group without revealing which member signed the message. In other words, a ring signature makes it impossible to determine who exactly in the group signed the message, while still proving that someone in the group did sign it. 

The name “ring signature” comes from the way the signature is created. It involves a “ring” of public keys belonging to group members, and the signature is formed by combining the signer’s  private  key  with  the  public  keys  of  other  members  in  the  ring.  The  result  is  a signature that can be verified by anyone using the group’s public keys but cannot be traced back to the individual who signed it. 

Ring signatures have a variety of applications, including enhancing privacy in blockchain transactions.  They  are  often  used  in  privacy-focused  cryptocurrencies  like  Monero  for example, to preserve the sender’s identity. This technology can then be expanded to many other  fields  and  has  a  wide  spectrum  of  application  that  we  will  explain  bellow  in  the document 

Ring signatures are XRPL and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) friendly because they are based on elliptic curve cryptography. In addition, ring signatures do not require any special hardware or software to run, as they can be implemented using smart contracts on any blockchain. 

Moreover, ring signatures are a proven and well-established cryptographic technique that has  been  widely  used  in  the  cryptocurrency  industry,  particularly  for  privacy-focused applications.  The  underlying  math  is  well-understood,  and  implementations  of  ring signatures have been tested and reviewed by the cryptography community, providing a high level of confidence in their security. 

Ring  signatures  are  also  highly  efficient,  allowing  for  fast  and  scalable  computation  of cryptographic signatures, which is important in the context of blockchain applications where speed and scalability are critical. As a result, ring signatures are a good choice for applications that  require  fast  and  secure  cryptographic  operations,  such  as  XRPL  Solvency  proof generation. 

Overall, the use of ring signatures in XRPL Solvency makes it an efficient and secure solution for generating verifiable solvency proofs on the XRPL lockchain. 

Ring signatures are considered scalable because they can be verified quickly and efficiently, even when the size of the signing group is very large. This is because the verification process only involves checking a single signature, rather than verifying multiple signatures from each member of the group. 

When a signature is generated using a ring signature scheme, it includes information about the entire group of public keys, but does not reveal which specific key was used to create the signature. This means that anyone can verify the signature by checking that it was produced using one of the public keys in the group, without having to perform additional computations to verify each individual key in the group. 

This makes ring signatures particularly useful in applications that require fast and efficient signature  verification, such  as  in  the  context  of  blockchain  transactions,  where  multiple signatures may need to be verified in a short period of time. Additionally, the fact that ring signatures are scalable makes them well-suited to use in decentralized systems, where many participants may need to sign and verify messages on a regular basis. 

**Proof of reserve** Current PoRs are carried out by independent entities. With our solution anyone  can  generate  a  PoR  via  an  open  source  and  verifiable  mechanism  based  on cryptographic concepts. This concept will be more developed in the future for institutions. 



4. **How<a name="_page4_x68.00_y117.00"></a> it works** 

**Step 1:** Generating the solvency proof 

Alice wants to generate a solvency proof for Bob: 

1. Alice visits our website 
1. She follows the easy steps 
1. She uses our Solvency proof generation program by downloading it 
1. If her proof is valid, Alice will receive a SoulBound Token (NFT) on her communication address as a proof of her solvability 
1. The SoulBoundToken can now be shown to anyone 

**Step 2:** Agreement 

Bob wants to verify Alice’s proof: 

1. Bob goes to XRPL Solvency’s Dapp, in the check proof section 
1. He fills in Alice’s communication address as well as the ID of the SoulBound token given by Alice 
1. If a corresponding SoulBound token owned by Alice exists, it will be displayed with all the relevant information 
1. Bob verifies all the information that he needs to know 

**Step 3:** Transferring the funds Once an agreement has been reached between Alice and Bob, Alice can send the various funds directly to Bob. But to increase his privacy, he will have to use a different wallet than the one linked to the generation of the proof of solvency.

**Step 3:** ![]()


5. **Use<a name="_page6_x68.00_y94.00"></a> Cases**

Solvency proofs open possibilities for many things, particularly those involving financial transactions on the blockchain. Here are some examples of use cases for solvency proofs: 

**Renting:** As described in the original MVP, solvency proofs can be used in the context of renting apartments or other properties. Landlords can require proof of solvency from tenants to ensure that they have the financial means to pay rent for a certain period of time. Solvency proofs can be generated without revealing the tenant’s wallet address or transaction history, protecting their privacy. 

**Loans:** Solvency proofs can also be used in the context of loans, where lenders may require proof of the borrower’s solvency before extending credit. By providing a solvency proof, borrowers can demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history to the lender. 

**Investments:** Solvency proofs can be used in the context of investments, where investors may  require  proof  of a  company’s  or  individual’s  solvency  before  investing  in them.  By providing a solvency proof, the company or individual can demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history to the investor. 

**Insurance:** Solvency proofs can also be used in the context of insurance, where insurers may require proof of the policyholder’s solvency before issuing a policy. By providing a solvency proof, the policyholder can demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history to the insurer. 

**Procurement:**  Solvency  proofs  can  be  used  in  the  context  of  procurement,  where government agencies or private companies may require proof of solvency from contractors before awarding contracts. By providing a solvency proof, contractors can demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history to the agency or company. 

**Real  estate  transactions:**  Solvency  proofs  can  be  used  in  the  context  of  real  estate transactions, where buyers or sellers may require proof of solvency before entering into a contract. By providing a solvency proof, the buyer or seller can demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history. 

**Gaming:** Solvency proofs can be used in the context of gaming and online gambling, where players may need to demonstrate their solvency in order to participate in certain games or tournaments.  By  providing  a  solvency  proof,  players  can  demonstrate  that  they  have sufficient funds to participate without revealing their wallet address or transaction history. 

**Charitable donations:** Solvency proofs can be used in the context of charitable donations, where donors may want to ensure that their contributions are going to a financially stable 


organization. By providing a solvency proof, the organization can demonstrate its financial status without revealing its wallet address or transaction history. 

**Crowdfunding:** Solvency proofs can be used in the context of crowdfunding campaigns, where organizers may need to demonstrate their solvency to potential backers. By providing a solvency proof, the organizer can demonstrate that they have the financial means to carry out the project without revealing their wallet address or transaction history. 

**Supply  chain  financing:**  Solvency  proofs  can  be  used  in  the  context  of  supply  chain financing,  where  suppliers  may  need  to  demonstrate  their  solvency  in  order  to  secure financing. By providing a solvency proof, the supplier can demonstrate its financial status without revealing its wallet address or transaction history to the financing party. 

These are just a few examples of the many potential use cases for solvency proofs. Any situation where a party needs to demonstrate their financial status without revealing their wallet address or transaction history on the blockchain could benefit from the use of solvency proofs.

XRPL Solvency enhances features that require to develop technical solutions for front-end and back-end development such as an indexer or an off-chain smart contract execution 14environment like “Codius”. 

**XRPL Solvency – Front End Application** 

The front-end application in react developed during the PBWS 2023 hackathon aims to offer the possibility to interact with the different ring signature functionalities and to issue proof of solvency for different use cases. 

***Structure:*** 

**Home page:** In this section you will learn more about our XRPL Solvency project and the “proof of solvency” that we can generate and issue thanks to ring signatures. There are many use cases and we have detailed some of them for you. 

**What are ring signatures?**  

Ring signatures are a cryptographic technique that allows a member of a group to sign a message on behalf of the group without revealing which member actually signed it. The concept was first introduced by Rivest, Shamir, and Tauman in 2001. The primary purpose of ring signatures is to enhance privacy and anonymity in digital communication. 

**What is the difference with ZK Proofs?**  

Ring signatures and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are both cryptographic techniques that enhance privacy and anonymity. However, they serve different purposes and have different properties. The reasons why ring signatures are a better fit to our model are the following:  

Ring signatures offer a relatively simpler cryptographic mechanism compared to ZKPs, which could  make  them  easier  to  understand,  implement,  and  maintain  in  our  solution.  This simplicity  might  lead  to  a  quicker  development  process  and  easier  adoption  by  the community.  

Also, as mentioned earlier, ring signatures are compatible with both XRPL and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environments due to their reliance on elliptic curve cryptography. In contrast, some ZKP schemes (e.g., zk-SNARKs) may require additional workarounds to be compatible with the existing cryptographic primitives used in these platforms, making the integration process more complex.  

Moreover,  some  ZKP  schemes,  like  zk-SNARKs,  require  a  trusted  setup  phase  where cryptographic parameters are generated. This process could introduce a centralization risk and might not align with the open-source and decentralized nature of  our project. Ring signatures do not require a trusted setup and are, therefore, more in line with the goals of our solution. 

Another  advantage  is  that  ring  signatures  are  specifically  designed  to  provide  signer anonymity  within  a  group,  which  is  the  primary  requirement  for  our  solvency  proof application. While ZKPs can also provide privacy, their broader scope might be overkill for our specific use case and may introduce unnecessary complexity.  

Finally, given that ring signatures are already used in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero, developers and users in the blockchain community might be more familiar with the concept. This familiarity can make it easier for our solution to gain traction and adoption. 

**How Ring Signatures Work:** 

First step is Group formation. A group of participants is formed, each with their own public- private key pair. The public keys of all members are combined to create a “ring” of public keys. Anyone can form this group, and it doesn't require the members to collaborate or even know each other. 

Then we generate the Signature. When a group member wants to sign a message, they use their private key and the public keys of the other group members to create the ring signature. The signature generation algorithm ensures that it is computationally infeasible to determine which member's private key was used to create the signature. The generated ring signature is attached to the message. 

Finally comes the signature verification When someone receives the signed message, they can use the ring of public keys to verify that the signature is valid and that it was created by one of the group members. However, they cannot determine which specific member signed the message.

**TECHNOLOGY**

Here is how our solution works in technical details.  There are 3 steps to building a proof of credit: 

The first is the construction of the ring that will serve as the anonymity set. This construction is done for the moment by recovering the last transactions on the network, then by checking that the different addresses participating in the transactions have at least the necessary amount  to  prove.  In  the  future,  we  will  try  to  make  the  construction  of  the  ring  more intelligent. Indeed, let's imagine that a known address associated to an exchange is in the ring, we will then be able to know that this address is not mine and thus increase the chances to link my identity to my address.  

The second is the signature itself. To do this we need the private key of the address that has the funds. Once in possession of this address and the anonymity set, the user can perform the signature.  This  signature  serves  as  proof  of  possession  of  an  address  with  at  least  the minimum required funds.  

The third is the SBT mint containing the signature data. To do this, we need the private key of the address where the person wants to receive the proof. Once we have this key, we can issue a mint transaction, where the signature data is stored on IPFS, and the URI of the NFT is an IPFS link. 

To verify the proof there are 2 steps:  

The first one is to retrieve the data from the SBT. To do so the user has to go to our website and in the page verify proof look for the desired address.  

Once this address is found, it only remains to copy the proof and to verify it on our executable. The executable checks the proof and then indicates if it is valid or not. 

11. **Sales<a name="_page18_x68.00_y71.00"></a> Strategies**

We aim our solution to be open source. However, the implementation would require some support. This help we provide would be how we generate profit in order to develop and extend. Here are some sales strategies that could be effective for our solution: 

**Targeted Advertising** 

Using targeted advertising to reach potential customers who are interested in privacy and solutions  for  the  blockchain.  This  can  include  targeting  users  of  existing  blockchain applications, social media advertising, and content marketing. 

**Partnerships and Referral Programs** 

Establishing  partnerships  with  existing  blockchain  companies  or  service  providers  and implementing referral programs that incentivize current users to refer new customers to the solution. 

**Content Marketing** 

Creating valuable and informative content about the solution and the importance of privacy in  the  blockchain  ecosystem.  This  content  can  be  shared  through  social  media,  email marketing, and other digital channels. 

**Public Speaking and Networking** 

Engaging  in  public  speaking  opportunities,  attending  conferences  and  events,  and networking with key stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem to raise awareness about the solution and build relationships with potential customers and partners. 

**Free Trials and Demonstrations** 

Offering free trials or demonstrations of the solution to potential customers, allowing them to experience the benefits of the solution firsthand and build trust in the product. 

**Influencer Marketing** 

Collaborating with influencers in the blockchain space who have a significant following and a strong reputation to promote the solution to their audience. 

**Discounts and Promotions** 

Offering discounts or promotions for early adopters or for customers who refer new business to the solution can help incentivize customers to try the product and spread the word to others. 

12. **Team<a name="_page19_x68.00_y71.00"></a>**

That is the key: the team consists of committed people who love what they do. We are 4 engineering students bound by our passion and commitment for blockchain and Web3. We want to develop innovative solutions that will help the whole ecosystem expand. Too many times have we seen privacy being set aside in projects, and we want to be able to change that. That is why Maxime, Thomas, Nathan and Adam are glad to present XRPL Solvency, the solution for real privacy. 

By addressing the need for privacy in the blockchain ecosystem while having a real utility in our daily life, XRPL Solvency has the potential to be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses alike.
